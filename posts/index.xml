      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This text reflects my own view about a song lyrics and it does not represent any official or definitive interpretation about it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I just love the 80s synth-pop style. It produces in me a strange kind of nostalgia (since I was born in the 90&amp;rsquo;s and all my knowledge about this music comes from the Internet age, in which styles and tastes have became more and more mixed and timeless) and appeal, with bands like Tears for Fears, Duran Duran, Naked Eyes, Human League and my favorite one, Depeche Mode, composing a soundtrack for my daily activities in a way that sometimes I even forget that these tunes were recorded decades ago and pop music has dramatically changed since then.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
